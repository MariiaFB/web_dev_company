        <figcaption>Our virtual cloud hosting allows you to instantly add extra capacity for website expansion or traffic peaks as your business grows.  Imagine racks of servers in a data center, combined into a massive pool of resources called a "cloud".  Because you're not limited by the hardware capacity of a single server, hosting your website in Intechnic's cloud is remarkably flexible, giving you server resources that you need at the moment.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>Load Balancing is recommended for websites with huge amounts of traffic, automatically distributing incoming traffic across multiple servers in a cluster or clouds.  It maximizes reliability, minimizes response time and avoids overloading, which enables us to achieve greater fault tolerance by seamlessly providing the right amount of resources needed in response to incoming traffic.
